## Highlights

This is a product of teamwork with Daniil Krivelov, while he worked on creating the UI design and firebase I created the game engine and the levels, we both were working on the repo, fortunately enough through the development process, we didn't have any conflicts.

## Credits
* The App idea was part of a Mobile subject led by _Lidia Ivanova_ in the first semester of the second year of the university.
